## üëæ Design Philosophy

Swow is committed to using the smallest C core and most of the PHP code to support PHP high-performance network programming,
which determines that it is more about providing powerful secondary development capabilities by seamlessly integrating PHP code and C kernel,
while ensuring critical performance.

In addition, it provides a variety of debugging mechanisms and powerful and low-threshold debugging tools,
which can ensure that developers are free from the trouble of BUGs as much as possible,
and ordinary developers can also have the ability to debug near the level of experts with the help of tools,
so as to maximize development efficiency.

## üéÆ Installation

> Like any open source project, Swow always provides the strongest stability and features in **the newest release**, please try to ensure that you are using the latest version.

### üîé Requirements

- Common operating systems such as Linux, Windows, macOS, etc. Almost same as [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/blob/v1.x/SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS.md)
- PHP 8.0.0 or above, the latest version is recommended

### üë®‚Äçüé§ By Composer

pull source code:

```shell
composer require swow/swow
```

Then run the automatic installer `swow-builder` under the `vendor/bin` directory to start the installation:

```shell
./vendor/bin/swow-builder --install
```

After you update the source code of Swow, you should use the `rebuild` option to recompile Swow and then install it:

```shell
./vendor/bin/swow-builder --rebuild --install
```

More information about `swow-builder` can be found in [Extension installation document - By Composer](https://docs.toast.run/swow/en/install.html).

### üêß Manual installation (UNIX-like)

clone the Swow (You can also import it through Composer, and then cd to `vendor/swow/swow/ext` and install manually):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/swow/swow.git
````

Well-known building procedure. Install to the system with root privileges:
